# Toolset

We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to the incredible open source projects that form the backbone of our work.

- [Shaka Packager](https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-packager) - tool and a media packaging SDK for DASH and HLS packaging and encryption. It can prepare and package media content for online streaming.
- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) - a collection of libraries and tools to process multimedia content such as audio, video, subtitles and related metadata.
- [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) - a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture.
- [ts-rest](https://ts-rest.com/) - a simple way to define a contract for your API, which can be both consumed and implemented by your application, giving you end to end type safety without the hassle or code generation.

Keep up the awesome work!
